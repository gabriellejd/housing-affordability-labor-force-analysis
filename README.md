# housing-affordability-labor-force-analysis

Project Overview:
This project analyzes the relationship between housing affordability and labor force participation across U.S. counties using 2023 American Community Survey data. Using multiple regression models and interaction terms, it evaluates whether housing cost burdens are associated with workforce participation rates.

Why this project is useful:
Housing affordability is often cited as a barrier to workforce participation, but the strength and consistency of this relationship is unclear. This project demonstrates how quantitative analysis and regression modeling can be used to test policy assumptions, interpret null results, and identify other structural factors influencing labor outcomes.
